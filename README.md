# Neural Networks
In this project I am implementing a simple neural network from scratch. Theory is gathered from the lecture slides of Soft Computing by Prof. Matteo Matteucci at Politecnico di Milano. 

## Perceptron
The perceptron is in my implementation a neural network without any hidden layers, and only two inputs. It is, for example, possible to fit the perceptron as a logical AND/OR operator.
